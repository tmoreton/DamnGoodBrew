				<h1><b>Our Story</b></h1>
				<h4>Hi! My name is Tim and I am the founder of <b>Damn Good Brew</b>.</h4>
				<br/>

				<p>The story of how & why I started Damn Good Brew actually started on June 13th 2016. That was the day that I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer. I don't tell you this to be a pity story, in fact it's actually the exact opposite. I have always heard that, "What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger" but I could never truly understand that quote until that day.</p>

				<p>A day that seemed at the time like the worst day of my life, has actually become a turning point to start pursuing my dreams and focus my efforts in creating the life I truly want for myself. I was lucky enough that I had caught the cancer early and after surgery and a few months of recovery I have been happily cancer free since. After that I had decided that I was going to quit my job as a Software Engineer in NYC and pursue my dreams of building a company and traveling the world!</p>
				
				<p>6 Months after I was diagnosed (I had to wait until my lease was up of course) I quit my job in pursuit of making those dreams a reality. So I dived right in and moved to Argentina & Peru for 2 months while I started started freelancing as a Software Engineer. Since then I have built 5 iPhone apps, 4 eCommerce stores, too many websites to count and traveled to 15 countries.</p>

				<p>Ever since I had recovered I have been constantly thinking of ways I could raise money or awareness around cancer and personal health in general. There is one month out of the year that is dedicated to men's health awareness with no-shave november which is where I came up with the idea of the Damn Good Brew beard logo.</p>
				<p><b>So as a company we will be donating 5% of all of the profits year round to cancer research in the same hospital I was treated so that I know it's going to good use!</b></p>
				<br/>

				<h3><b>Why A Coffee Company?</b></h3>
				<p>Enter my passion for coffee. I will be the first to admit I didn't always love coffee, in fact I was more of a tea guy. But since I had started traveling and working in different countries around the world as a freelancer, the best places for good wifi were the local coffee shops. Here is where I tried different types of coffee from places like Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Lima, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Thailand & of course Colombia. I found that while ordering similar items, they all tasted so different in an amazing way.</p>

				<p>I started researching the differences between which countries the beans were sourced, the types of roast from light to dark, the way that it was brewed hot or cold and even the type of grind from fine to coarse. Every single aspect of the coffee making process changed the taste just enough and so I started brewing my own at home adjusting all of the different variables to find the best type of coffee. I personally like Cold Brew the best as it preserves the flavor of the bean but I was making gallons of different brews and making a huge mess in the process. That's where I came up with the idea for the Damn Good Brew bags.</p>
